I. CORE FOUNDATIONS
The "Bedrock" of CS. These principles govern how software 
interacts with hardware and how problems are solved.

* Algorithms & Data Structures (DSA):
  Efficient data organization (Trees, Graphs, Hash Maps)
  and optimization of problem-solving procedures.
  
* Computer Architecture:
  The design and operation of CPU, memory systems, 
  and I/O interfaces.

* Operating Systems (OS):
  Resource management, concurrency, and process 
  scheduling (Linux, Windows, RTOS).

* Theory of Computation:
  Exploring the limits of what can be computed 
  (Automata, Complexity classes).

-----------------------------------------------------

II. MAJOR DOMAINS & SPECIALIZATIONS
High-demand niches in the 2026 job market:

1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Machine Learning:
